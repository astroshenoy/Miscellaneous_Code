# Miscellaneous_Code
A collection of random code snippets useful for my PhD work

In matching_catalogs.py, I have code to combine two catalogues using multiple common columns. 
Example, I wanted to combine spectroscopic MPAJHU catalog with the photometric GSWL Catalog but
one had specobjIDs and one had photoObjIDs. I used FiberID, MJD and PlateIDs to combine the two catalogues.
